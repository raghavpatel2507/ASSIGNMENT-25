    "Linear regression relies on several key assumptions for accurate and reliable results. It is essential to assess whether these assumptions hold in a given dataset to ensure the validity of the regression analysis. Here are the assumptions of linear regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linearity: The relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variables should be linear. You can check this assumption by creating scatter plots of the variables and visually inspecting if they exhibit a linear pattern. Additionally, you can use techniques like partial regression plots or residual plots to detect non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence: The observations in the dataset should be independent of each other. This assumption implies that the residuals or errors should not be correlated. You can examine this assumption by plotting the residuals against the order of observations or time. If there is a pattern or correlation in the residuals, it suggests a violation of independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Homoscedasticity: The variability of the residuals should be constant across all levels of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of the residuals should not systematically change as the predicted values change. You can assess homoscedasticity by plotting the residuals against the predicted values or the independent variables. If the spread of the residuals appears to fan out or form a funnel shape, it indicates heteroscedasticity, which violates this assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normality: The residuals should follow a normal distribution. This assumption ensures that the statistical inference and hypothesis testing conducted on the regression model are valid. You can check the normality assumption by creating a histogram or a Q-Q plot of the residuals. If the distribution of residuals deviates significantly from a bell-shaped curve, it suggests a departure from normality.\n",
    "\n",
    "No multicollinearity: In multiple linear regression, the independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other. Multicollinearity can lead to unstable and unreliable coefficient estimates. You can assess multicollinearity by calculating the correlation matrix among the independent variables. If the correlation coefficients are close to +1 or -1, it indicates high multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check these assumptions, you can use diagnostic techniques such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Residual analysis: Examine the residuals for patterns, outliers, or non-linear relationships.\n",
    "Scatter plots: Plot the dependent variable against each independent variable to assess linearity.\n",
    "Residual plots: Plot the residuals against predicted values or independent variables to assess independence and homoscedasticity.\n",
    "Normality tests: Perform statistical tests like the Shapiro-Wilk test or visually inspect the histogram and Q-Q plot of residuals.\n",
    "Variance inflation factor (VIF): Calculate VIF values for independent variables to detect multicollinearity.\n",
    "If the assumptions are violated, it may be necessary to apply appropriate transformations, consider non-linear models, remove influential outliers, or address multicollinearity through variable selection techniques or data preprocessing methods.\n"

    "Intercept (β0):\n",
    "The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are set to zero. It is the point where the regression line intersects the y-axis. The intercept captures the baseline value of the dependent variable when there is no influence from the independent variables.\n",
    "Interpretation: For example, in a linear regression model predicting house prices based on square footage, the intercept represents the estimated price of a house with zero square footage. While this value is not meaningful in the real world, the intercept provides a reference point for the regression line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slope (β1, β2, etc.):\n",
    "The slope(s) represent the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the corresponding independent variable, holding other variables constant. Each independent variable in the model has its own slope coefficient.\n",
    "Interpretation: Continuing with the house price example, suppose we have a multiple linear regression model with two independent variables: square footage (x1) and number of bedrooms (x2). The coefficient β1 represents the change in house price for a one-unit increase in square footage, while β2 represents the change in house price for a one-unit increase in the number of bedrooms. A positive slope indicates that an increase in the independent variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable, and vice versa for a negative slope.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, if β1 is 50, it means that, on average, for every additional square foot of living space, the house price increases by $50, assuming the number of bedrooms and other variables remain constant. Similarly, if β2 is -10, it means that, on average, each additional bedroom is associated with a decrease of $10 in the house price, holding square footage constant.\n",

    "\n",
    "Iterate steps 2 to 4 until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., a maximum number of iterations or the cost function reaches a certain threshold).\n",
    "At each iteration, the parameters are updated, and the cost function is recalculated.\n",
    "The process of computing gradients and updating parameters continues until the algorithm converges to the minimum of the cost function. The learning rate determines the step size taken in each iteration. A high learning rate may lead to overshooting the minimum, while a low learning rate may slow down convergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient descent is used in various machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and deep learning models. It enables these models to iteratively learn and adjust their parameters based on the training data, optimizing their performance and fitting the data more accurately. By minimizing the cost function, gradient descent helps in finding the optimal values of the parameters that yield the best predictions or classifications for new, unseen data.\n",
